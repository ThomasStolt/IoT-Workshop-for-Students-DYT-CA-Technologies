# Deploy Your Talent

This repository collects material around a workshop to help students (we ran this with students at the age around 14) get a taste of IT technology and coding. 

We use a simple IoT example, based on MicroPython, an ESP2866 Microcontroller (in the form of NodeMCU) on a breadboard, lights (NeoPixel LEDs), a temperature sensor (DS18B20) and an MQTT broker (sitting on a RaspberryPi) to show how simple it is for students to built their own IoT application.
Here is an example of how the breadboard is to be built:

At the end of this workshop (about 45 minutes), the students should have a rough understanding of what (technologies) IoT is made up of and be able to control a ring of LEDs from their phone and vice versa read/see temperature of a sensor on their phone.  The attached picture is what they will build during this workshop, we will walk them through each bit. (The presentation animates this graphic.)

The cost of a single workplace (per student) is around 15€. To recreate this workshop, a public MQTT broker service (such as Adafruit.io) will do, to run a class of 10 or more students, you'll need to set up your own MQTT broker (mosquitto with NodeRED) somewhere.

Feel free to use this workshop as is, improve it or send us pull requests! Contact us with any questions.

Thanks
