# Deploy-Your-Talent

This repository collects material around a workshop that a team of consultants at CA Technologies created to help students (aged around 14) get a taste of IT technology and coding. CA running a world wide program, through which CA invests a lot time, money and other resources to promote STEM education. We are a group of enthusiastic employees who contribute to this program, there are other CA employees who do similar things.

We use a simple IoT example, based on MircoPython, an ESP2866 Microcontroller (NodeMCU), lights (NeoPixel LEDs), a temperature sensor (DS18B20) and an MQTT broker (sitting on a RaspberryPi) to show how simple students can built their own IoT application.

At the end of this workshop (about 45 minutes), the students should be able to control a ring of LEDs from their phone and vice versa read/see temperature of a sensor on their phone.

The cost of a single workplace (per student) is around 15€. To recreate this workshop, a public MQTT broker service (such as Adafruit.io) will do, to run a class of 10 or more students, you'll need to set up your own MQTT broker somewhere.

Feel free to us this workshop as is, improve it or send us pull requests! Contact us with any questions.

Thanks
